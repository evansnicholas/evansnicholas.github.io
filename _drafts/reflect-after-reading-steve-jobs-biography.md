title: Reflect after Reading - Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
---
After I finished reading Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson I tried to recall the image I had of Jobs before I started reading the book.  This image was not sharp, and consisted mainly of various fragments that I had never taken the time to try and piece together into a coherent whole.  His jeans and black turtleneck uniform came to mind.  I had heard stories about his infamous bad temper.  I knew he had suffered from illness in the last years of his life and had died (relatively) young.  I was curious about his credentials: did he have a technical background? And what exactly was his role at Apple: did he think up the products in all their detail? Or was he predominantly a charismatic leader, steering the ship from a management pedestal?  

## The First Third

The book's first 200 pages cover the Jobs story from his childhood as the adopted son of Paul and Clara Jobs to his expulsion from Apple in 1985.  This first third of the book (corresponding to the first 30 years of Jobs' life) is the most colourful, and provides all the ingredients for understanding the main traits of the Jobs character (or at least the interpretation thereof given by the author Isaacson).  

We learn that Jobs' (adoptive) father was a gifted tinkerer, and instilled in his son the importance of good craftmanship even for the parts that are not visible in the end product (for instance, the backside of a wooden bookshelf that will always be placed against a wall).  We hear how a young Jobs befriended engineur-extraordinaire Steve Wozniak and how they hacked the AT&T long-distance telephone routing system.  This allowed them to make long distance calls for free.  This first collaboration lead to the creation of a magic box which enabled these long distance calls and which Jobs was quick to try and sell.  This venture ended unsuccessfully but the writing was on the wall.  But even before it all kicked off with the creation of the Apple computer, the Jobs-Wozniak partnership made another "dent in history" (as Jobs like to say) at Atari (where Jobs was working nnightshifts because no one could stand his bad body odour and capricious personality).  Together the two created "breakout", one of the all-time classic video games.  

One of my favourite passages from this first third is the description of how Bill Atkinson developed the famous QuickDraw algorithm, which enabled the first Macintosh to have a blazingly fast graphical display that was unparalleled in any other desktop at the time.  The book recounts how Atkinson was driven by the belief that he had seen such a graphical display during the demo the Macintosh team were given at Xerox PARC.  He worked feverishly trying to recreate the functionality and once he achieved it, it turned out that the Xerox computers actually were far less advanced that he had convinced himself they were.  We would later credit this mistake with giving him the necessary belief that what he wanted to achieve was actually possible.  Had he known beforehand that no such functionality yet existed, he may not have had the courage to embark on the project at all.  

## The Jobs Way

I like this passage because, when interpreted favourably, it illustrates the best of what Apple is, and of what Jobs could stimulate as a micromanaging product visionary.  When interpreted more critically, it also contains all the more dark elements of Jobs' management style and ruthless opportunism.
